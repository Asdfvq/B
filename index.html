    <p class="di2">Hay Di..üíô‚ù§Ô∏è,</p>
    <p class="di3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems two years, you came into my life. I am eternally grateful to God that you came into my life. I am also thankful to you for giving me your valuable time,Love.It is hard to understand how two years have passed.I am a negative person, thats why maybe I didn't realize how much you love me.But now I want to look our story in a positive way. I don't know how much I can do it but I'll try.You are the one who taught me to love. Thanks for everything that you give me in last two years. Perhaps this was the time I dreaded the most. Maybe you and I have different paths from here. Can't I have you and only you for a while before it's all over?, In a place where nobody is available between me and my Di. No problem if not possible though. GoodBye Doraemon!.</p>
